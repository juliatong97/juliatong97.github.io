<h2>The History of Bobbleheads</h2>

<p>
The history of bobblehead could be tracked back to 1840’s in Russia, when the first plaster bobblehead was made by the local sculptors. In spite of the long history, it didn’t gain in popularity till 1960’s when the first serial baseball bobbleheads was released by the American Major Baseball League team San Francisco Giants. </p>

<p>
Bobbing their way in and out of popular culture in their various manifestations for half a century, bobbleheads are becoming one of the world’s most recognisable personalized gift culture in recent times. In North American, over 10 million custom bobbleheads are created as Christmas gifts every year.</p>
